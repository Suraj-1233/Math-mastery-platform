Concept of Deviation Find Average of 40, 42, 35, 50, 85 Traditional method is to add all the numbers and divide by the number of observations but this method is lengthy and calculative.

Step I : Find the difference of average from each number (deviation) Step III: Add the deviation and divide it by total number of observations.
